# qml-pipeline

## Overview
The qml-pipeline project is designed to facilitate the integration of quantum computing techniques with classical machine learning methods. It provides a framework for building and evaluating quantum-enhanced pipelines, particularly focusing on feature encoding and variational algorithms.

## Installation
To set up the project, ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
- `src/qml_pipeline/`: Contains the core functionality of the pipeline.
  - `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package.
  - `pipeline.py`: Main logic for managing data flow through the pipeline.
  - `model_io.py`: Handles loading and saving model configurations and results.
  - `encoder.py`: Implements encoding techniques, including quantum feature encoding.
  - `variational.py`: Defines variational circuits and optimization methods.
  - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for data processing and support.

- `src/tools/`: Contains utility scripts.
  - `run_pipeline.py`: A minimal runner for executing the pipeline model defined in a JSON file.

- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the project.
  - `test_pipeline.py`: Tests for the functionality in `pipeline.py`.
  - `test_utils.py`: Tests for utility functions in `utils.py`.

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.
  - `experiments.ipynb`: Exploration of the pipeline with code snippets and visualizations.

## Usage
To run the pipeline, use the following command:

```
python src/tools/run_pipeline.py path/to/pipeline_model.json
```

Replace `path/to/pipeline_model.json` with the path to your pipeline model JSON file.
